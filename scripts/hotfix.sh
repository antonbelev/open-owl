# Open Owl Hotfix Script
#
# This script handles emergency hotfixes by:
# 1. Ensuring you're on a hotfix branch (hotfix/vX.Y.Z-description)
# 2. Bumping patch version and updating changelog
# 3. Merging to both main and develop
# 4. Tagging and pushing (triggers release build)
#
# Usage:
#   # First, create hotfix branch from main:
#   git checkout main
#   git checkout -b hotfix/v0.2.1-security-fix
#
#   # Make your fixes, commit them
#   git commit -m "fix(security): sanitize user inputs"
#
#   # Run this script to finalize the hotfix
#   ./scripts/hotfix.sh
