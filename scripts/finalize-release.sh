# Open Owl Release Finalization Script
#
# This script finalizes a release by:
# 1. Merging release branch to main
# 2. Tagging the release
# 3. Pushing tag (triggers GitHub Actions build)
# 4. Merging release branch back to develop
# 5. Cleaning up release branch
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/finalize-release.sh
#
# IMPORTANT: Run this from the release branch
